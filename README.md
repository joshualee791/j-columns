## Add ACF Fields as Sortable Columns in Pages Admin for Wordpress

Have you ever wanted to use the free version of Advanced Custom Fields plugin for Wordpress to categorize and sort your pages in the admin view? Well, feel free to use this plugin as a solution to your problem.

I wrote this for my job as a webdev for a digital marketing agency, hence the dental nomenclature in the code. To customize it, take the following steps:

1. Replace 'Specialist Content' in line 13 with the column label of your choice
2. Replace 'specialist_content_category' on lines 20, 27, 37, & 38 with the field name from ACF that you want a column for.
3. Enjoy!
